<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>End-to-end (E2E) testing is one of my favourite methodologies; used to ensure that applications behave as expected from the real-world end user’s perspective.</p>

<p>E2E testing is a fascinating technique to evaluate application flows, often used in agile software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology.</p>

<h2 id="manual-vs-automated">Manual vs Automated</h2>

<p>Manual testing is the most primitive technique to help find bugs and defects. This method is crucial for user-friendly software development because every test cases require human intervention for execution.</p>

<p>Automation testing is an approach that performs with the help of an automation tool. As a project grows, manually performing everything will become cumbersome. This intricacy makes automation essential as it helps to increase the effectiveness, coverage, and efficiency of software testing.</p>

<h2 id="horizontal-vs-vertical">Horizontal vs Vertical</h2>

<p>Horizontal E2E testing covers the entire application. It requires development teams to have clear-cut workflows and established environments.</p>

<p>Vertical E2E testing breaks down the application into layers (or components). It often precedes their horizontal counterparts because of this granularity.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>E2E plays a vital role in ensuring a satisfactory user experience. The goal is to eradicate regression bugs and defects.</p>]]></content><author><name>Syafiq Hadzir</name></author><category term="QA" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Table of Contents]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rijndael Block Cypher</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/12/16/rijndael-block-cypher.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rijndael Block Cypher" /><published>2022-12-16T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-12-16T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/12/16/rijndael-block-cypher</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/12/16/rijndael-block-cypher.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Rijndael or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is the new standard of symmetric block cyphers selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to replace the old Data Encryption Standard (DES).</p>

<p>Rijndael has its origins in Square, another algorithm designed by the pair; the Belgian cryptologists, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. I think that is enough for an introduction.</p>

<h2 id="basic-characteristics">Basic Characteristics</h2>

<p>Rijndael is a block cypher using 128, 192 and 256-bit input/output blocks and keys. Rijndael is also an iterated block cipher, meaning that it encrypts and decrypts a block of data by the iteration or round of a specific transformation.</p>

<p>If you do have any curiosity, Google is just a few letters away.</p>

<h2 id="encryption-and-decryption-algorithms">Encryption and Decryption Algorithms</h2>

<p>Encryption and decryption algorithms for 128-bit input/output blocks and user keys are depicted in (a) and (b) respectively. Both encryption and decryption algorithms use the different ordering of basic operations. The decryption operation implements the inverse version of the encryption operation. As a consequence of this fact, resource sharing between both logic is very limited.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how stability, availability, scalability, reliability, durability, resiliency (I think it’s enough), and responsiveness of an application hold up under a given workload.</p>

<p>There are many types of tests, each of which serves a particular objective. That is why it is important to understand how software performs on users’ systems.</p>

<h2 id="smoke-testing">Smoke Testing</h2>

<p>A smoke test (or build verification testing) is a test configured to determine software stability.</p>

<p>Long story short, the term “smoke test” originated in hardware repair. A device would fail the test if it caught on fire. Easy to explain.</p>

<p>However, smoke tests do not cover every permutation and edge case.</p>

<h2 id="load-testing">Load Testing</h2>

<p>Load tests simulate real-life application load. The goal is to compare the actual and the expected metrics for the performance in terms of concurrent users or requests per second.</p>

<p>These metrics include response time, throughput, percentage of errors, resource usage, et cetera.</p>

<h2 id="stress-testing">Stress Testing</h2>

<p>It might be hard to distinguish between load testing and stress testing. (This is the reason why people are often confused about the terms.)</p>

<p>Stress (or Spike) Testing is a type of load testing used to determine the stability and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.</p>

<h2 id="soak-testing">Soak Testing</h2>

<p>Soak Testing (also Endurance Testing) assesses the system’s performance and reliability by uncovering issues stemming from a system being under pressure for an extended period.</p>

<p>For any inquiry, kindly help yourself to Google it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It is all about reputation, based on performance and efficiency in delivering something. It is not just about software quality but how prepared we are to face any inevitable challenges in life.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Software quality assurance (QA) and testing professionals recognize these abbreviations: SRS, FRS, and BRS, which mean “software”, “functional”, and “business” requirement specifications.</p>

<p>These are the documents used when referring to comprehensive requirements for a product based on the client’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="software-requirement-specification">Software Requirement Specification</h2>

<p>Software Requirement Specification (SRS) outlines the summary of a project, covering the functionality and features, as well as the desired business goal. Since an SRS includes a framework for each team member to follow, it enhances the efficiency of the development process.</p>

<h2 id="functional-requirement-specification">Functional Requirement Specification</h2>

<p>Functional Requirement Specification (FRS) offers the main point of interest. It is the most detailed document ever produced by developers and testers. It covers all software components, expected interactions, business aspects, compliance, and security specifications.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of an FRS is to satisfy all the requirements listed in the SRS and BRS documents.</p>

<h2 id="business-requirement-specification">Business Requirement Specification</h2>

<p>Business Requirement Specification (BRS) highlights the approach towards fulfilling the client’s requirements on a general level.</p>

<p>Whereas the SRS and FRS provide a roadmap for developers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Never forget this fact; besides all the technical requirements and specifications, our software development has its business side too.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Software Testing is categorized objectively into two (2) types, functional and non-functional testing.</p>

<h2 id="functional-testing">Functional Testing</h2>

<p>Functional testing involves validating software functions; to operate in conformance with the specifications or business requirements.</p>

<p>It aims at verifying each feature of the application by matching the expected result with the actual result.</p>

<h2 id="non-functional-testing">Non-Functional Testing</h2>

<p>Non-functional testing focuses on non-functional attributes, as the name suggests, including the system requirements, e.g., performance, reliability, security, scalability, and usability.</p>

<p>Reciprocal to each criterion, we can have one or more types of testing, e.g., performance testing that includes load, stress, endurance, spike, and volume testing.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These are all the prerequisite understanding that a QA engineer should acquire as knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Communication is essential. Nobody dares to deny the fact of communication. Nat Turner, believed, once said, “Good communication is the bridge between confusion and clarity”. As QA engineers, we should be experts in this dexterity. Effective communication promotes trust.</p>

<p>There are the seven (7) C’s, a list of communication principles, for both spoken and written, to ensure clear, correct, complete, concrete, concise, considered and courteous conversation. That’s it. I have just listed it down. As the saying goes, “Communication works for those who work at it”.</p>

<h2 id="document-the-work">Document The Work</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about how hard it is to document the code. I am aware of this concern. That is why I am always suggesting “coding the documentation” instead.</p>

<p>As a QA engineer, I do notice the fact that I spend far more time reading code than developing it.</p>

<p>But how is it to code the documentation? Here are another 3 C’s from Nigel Wilson. One must try to make his code provides consistency, compliance and completeness.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Consistency: The crucial thing that holds our understanding together. We don’t want everything feels disorienting and disorganised, is not it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compliance: Getting everyone to comply with policies and procedures is the utmost priority; to ensure that they are committed deeply to making theories realities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completeness: The holy grail of documentation. Without it, things may take the trail off into nothing, leaving team members halfway through tasks with nowhere to go but down.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Software testing is nothing but an art of quality inspection. The only key to success in software testing is to fulfil the must-have prerequisite, a solid understanding of the fundamentals. Due to its vast subject, I wish to write this as concisely as possible.</p>

<h2 id="all-codes-are-guilty-until-proven-innocent">All Codes Are Guilty Until Proven Innocent</h2>

<p>It says that every software application has defects embedded in it. However, not each of them is a threat. We all agree that one may be blind to one’s own mistakes. Therefore, it is essential to have a third-party inspection. Here is where software testing comes into play.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-defect">What is a Defect?</h2>

<p>According to Mirriam-Webster, a defect is “an imperfection or abnormality that impairs quality, function, or utility”. In software testing, it is “a deviation from the specified or expected behaviour that is visible to end-users”. It can be either a functional defect, a non-functional defect, or a combination of both.
Defects may exist either in the code or in its design. To a certain extent, it is a subjective matter. For example, a defect may be a feature to some people. However, it is a defect to others. Therefore, it is essential to recognise what is a defect and what is not.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-severity-and-priority">What are Severity and Priority?</h2>

<p>Severity defines the degree of impact that a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system. The severity can be of one of the following types (and I use all the definitions from ISTQB):-</p>

<ol>
  <li>Critical (S1): The defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround.</li>
  <li>Major (S2): The defect affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not obvious and is difficult.</li>
  <li>Minor (S3): The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround.</li>
  <li>Trivial (S4): The defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Fundamentals are the foundation to understand that software testing is not just a process, but a solution.</p>]]></content><author><name>Syafiq Hadzir</name></author><category term="QA" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Table of Contents]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">QA and Web Design</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/14/qa-and-web-design.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QA and Web Design" /><published>2022-11-14T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-11-14T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/14/qa-and-web-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/14/qa-and-web-design.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="who-are-qa-engineers">Who Are QA Engineers?</h2>

<p>Let us start with an introduction to quality assurance (QA) engineers.
QA engineers refer to one of the most crucial members (often underrated) of the design and development process, running various testing on the functionality of web applications.
It is good to remind each time we read about QA. QA is about testing, QA is about finding bugs, and yes, QA is vital to gauge web performance.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-qa-related-to-design">Why Is QA Related to Design?</h2>

<p>Web design is about visual quality, which is also one of the QA responsibilities to measure. The idea is to maintain the overall quality; therefore, QA engineers are often involved in design development.
Some criteria on the checklist to ensure a high-quality UI/UX deliverable are usability, accessibility, consistency, and compatibility.
Finally, yet importantly, there’s no doubt that there’s nothing more annoying than a slow-performing website.</p>

<h2 id="what-design-need-to-do-with-qa">What Design Need to Do with QA</h2>

<p>QA engineers see products through different lenses. They keep everything documented where there are functional or interaction issues to shed light on unforeseen bugs by going through the software and following the ideal experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>QA testers should never be satisfied with “good enough” solutions. Always remember: the Q stands for quality. Assure it by practising that quality yourself.</p>]]></content><author><name>Syafiq Hadzir</name></author><category term="QA" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Table of Contents]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">QA Engineers for SEO</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/11/qa-engineers-for-seo.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QA Engineers for SEO" /><published>2022-11-11T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-11-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/11/qa-engineers-for-seo</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/11/qa-engineers-for-seo.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="seo-helps-to-improve-web-quality">SEO Helps to Improve Web Quality</h2>

<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is a colossal challenge and is unlikely to be associated with quality assurance (QA).
Most will see both SEO analysts and QA engineers work in different departments. Yet we should know that the QA position revolves around evaluating the overall quality of a web application.
In this post, I will not go deep down to explain everything. Everything written here is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h2 id="will-qa-engineers-replace-seo-analysts">Will QA Engineers Replace SEO Analysts?</h2>

<p>You might not understand if you do not know the definition of being an SEO analyst. An SEO analyst works hard days (and nights) to study the ever-changing trends and algorithms. While QA engineers, we ensure the quality of everything, from documentation to post-deployment. From the beginning of time until the post-apocalyptic era.
The answer is no. You can not replace a butcher with a fishmonger.</p>

<h2 id="how-qa-helps-to-improve-seo">How QA Helps to Improve SEO?</h2>

<p>Each update brings risks. That is why we should remind ourselves what it costs for each deployment. Various touchpoints can affect SEO, the meta tags, AMP links or the reciprocal canonical links, and the more hands in the mix starting from engineers, designers, and content writers.
Essentially, if the mobile site is separate (or adaptive), then the work is double!
Anyone who wants to do the daunting tasks? Of course, the QA engineers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>SEO is a big topic of nuances and takes a tremendous amount of time. Keeping an eye on its quality is a difficult task alongside its complexity increases proportionally parallel with new technologies. Thus, QA engineers should be ready to identify progressing trends to get a better insight and understanding of SEO.</p>]]></content><author><name>Syafiq Hadzir</name></author><category term="QA" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Table of Contents]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">QA Engineers Must Code</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/09/qa-engineers-must-code.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QA Engineers Must Code" /><published>2022-11-09T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2022-11-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/09/qa-engineers-must-code</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/2022/11/09/qa-engineers-must-code.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="should-qa-engineers-code">Should QA Engineers Code?</h2>

<p>Quality assurance (QA) engineers may not be as technical as developers; but that doesn’t mean QA shouldn’t learn nor write codes.</p>

<p>It is a ludicrous lack of understanding in concept of assurance when assigning an illiterate person to ensure a masterpiece (read: software) quality to customers.</p>

<h2 id="everyone-should-write-something">Everyone Should Write Something</h2>

<p>If the developers write codes and the managers write documentations, competent QA engineers write both. We are working in the intersections remember? Of course it won’t be writing as much as they would.</p>

<p>QA engineers should be edgy when it comes to technology. It’s good to live on the edges. We have plenty open-source tools around us to ease up the testing process. It will always end up useless for someone who can’t code. Not just you can’t ease yourself with tasks, you can’t even speak up to developers when it comes to technical matters.</p>

<p>There are plenty of testing methodologies that require code literacy. Unit testing, automation end-to-end testing, performance testing, security testing etc., you name it.</p>

<h2 id="qa-engineers-should-review-code">QA Engineers Should Review Code</h2>

<p>The concept of code review is often misunderstood. Thus, people tend to think that end-to-end testing is sufficient. But it is not. This confusion could bounce back with consequences to deal with.</p>

<p>In the age of Agile, code review is a must-have practice where the source code is broken into small pieces, which then is inspected by the supervisor. This should be done not only by developers, but QA testers as well.</p>

<p>Code review is the process where mistakes are detected and early bugs are caught. This will also be the time when you realise the importance of code comments.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>QA engineers must be literate enough to build static websites. By the way, HTML are just taggings and classes after all. Don’t worry, code won’t do harm, ignorance does.</p>]]></content><author><name>Syafiq Hadzir</name></author><category term="QA" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Table of Contents]]></summary></entry></feed>
