## Introduction

Software quality assurance (QA) and testing professionals recognize these abbreviations: SRS, FRS, and BRS, which mean “software”, “functional”, and “business” requirement specifications.

These are the documents used when referring to comprehensive requirements for a product based on the client’s needs.

## Software Requirement Specification

Software Requirement Specification (SRS) outlines the summary of a project, covering the functionality and features, as well as the desired business goal. Since an SRS includes a framework for each team member to follow, it enhances the efficiency of the development process.

## Functional Requirement Specification

Functional Requirement Specification (FRS) offers the main point of interest. It is the most detailed document ever produced by developers and testers. It covers all software components, expected interactions, business aspects, compliance, and security specifications.

The ultimate goal of an FRS is to satisfy all the requirements listed in the SRS and BRS documents.

## Business Requirement Specification

Business Requirement Specification (BRS) highlights the approach towards fulfilling the client’s requirements on a general level.

Whereas the SRS and FRS provide a roadmap for developers.

## Conclusion

Never forget this fact; besides all the technical requirements and specifications, our software development has its business side too.

Jim Highsmith, believed, once said, "Documentation is not understanding; (the) process is not discipline; formality is not skill."
