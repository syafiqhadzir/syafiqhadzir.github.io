## Who Are QA Engineers?

Let us start with an introduction to quality assurance (QA) engineers.
QA engineers refer to one of the most crucial members (often underrated) of the design and development process, running various testing on the functionality of web applications.
It is good to remind each time we read about QA. QA is about testing, QA is about finding bugs, and yes, QA is vital to gauge web performance.

## Why Is QA Related to Design?

Web design is about visual quality, which is also one of the QA responsibilities to measure. The idea is to maintain the overall quality; therefore, QA engineers are often involved in design development.
Some criteria on the checklist to ensure a high-quality UI/UX deliverable are usability, accessibility, consistency, and compatibility.
Finally, yet importantly, there's no doubt that there's nothing more annoying than a slow-performing website.

## What Design Need to Do with QA

QA engineers see products through different lenses. They keep everything documented where there are functional or interaction issues to shed light on unforeseen bugs by going through the software and following the ideal experience.

## Conclusion

QA testers should never be satisfied with "good enough" solutions. Always remember: the Q stands for quality. Assure it by practising that quality yourself.
