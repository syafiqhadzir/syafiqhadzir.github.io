## Introduction

Communication is essential. Nobody dares to deny the fact of communication. Nat Turner, believed, once said, "Good communication is the bridge between confusion and clarity". As QA engineers, we should be experts in this dexterity. Effective communication promotes trust.

There are the seven (7) C's, a list of communication principles, for both spoken and written, to ensure clear, correct, complete, concrete, concise, considered and courteous conversation. That's it. I have just listed it down. As the saying goes, "Communication works for those who work at it".

## Document The Work

Let's talk about how hard it is to document the code. I am aware of this concern. That is why I am always suggesting "coding the documentation" instead.

As a QA engineer, I do notice the fact that I spend far more time reading code than developing it.

But how is it to code the documentation? Here are another 3 C's from Nigel Wilson. One must try to make his code provides consistency, compliance and completeness.

1. Consistency: The crucial thing that holds our understanding together. We don't want everything feels disorienting and disorganised, is not it?

2. Compliance: Getting everyone to comply with policies and procedures is the utmost priority; to ensure that they are committed deeply to making theories realities.

3. Completeness: The holy grail of documentation. Without it, things may take the trail off into nothing, leaving team members halfway through tasks with nowhere to go but down.

## Conclusion

Code commenting is a science as well as an art of coding. An eloquence art to precisely exchange thoughts and ideas.
