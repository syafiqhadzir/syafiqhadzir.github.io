## Introduction

Performance testing is a non-functional software testing technique that determines how stability, availability, scalability, reliability, durability, resiliency (I think it's enough), and responsiveness of an application hold up under a given workload.

There are many types of tests, each of which serves a particular objective. That is why it is important to understand how software performs on usersâ€™ systems.

## Smoke Testing

A smoke test (or build verification testing) is a test configured to determine software stability.

Long story short, the term "smoke test" originated in hardware repair. A device would fail the test if it caught on fire. Easy to explain.

However, smoke tests do not cover every permutation and edge case.

## Load Testing

Load tests simulate real-life application load. The goal is to compare the actual and the expected metrics for the performance in terms of concurrent users or requests per second.

These metrics include response time, throughput, percentage of errors, resource usage, et cetera.

## Stress Testing

It might be hard to distinguish between load testing and stress testing. (This is the reason why people are often confused about the terms.)

Stress (or Spike) Testing is a type of load testing used to determine the stability and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.

## Soak Testing

Soak Testing (also Endurance Testing) assesses the system's performance and reliability by uncovering issues stemming from a system being under pressure for an extended period.

For any inquiry, kindly help yourself to Google it.

## Conclusion

It is all about reputation, based on performance and efficiency in delivering something. It is not just about software quality but how prepared we are to face any inevitable challenges in life.

J. R. D. Tata, believed, once said, "Productivity and efficiency, can be achieved, only step by step, with sustained hard work, relentless attention to details and insistence on the highest standards of quality and performance."
