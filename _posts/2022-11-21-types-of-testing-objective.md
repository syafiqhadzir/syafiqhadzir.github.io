## Introduction

Software Testing is categorized objectively into two (2) types, functional and non-functional testing.

## Functional Testing

Functional testing involves validating software functions; to operate in conformance with the specifications or business requirements.

It aims at verifying each feature of the application by matching the expected result with the actual result.

## Non-Functional Testing

Non-functional testing focuses on non-functional attributes, as the name suggests, including the system requirements, e.g., performance, reliability, security, scalability, and usability.

Reciprocal to each criterion, we can have one or more types of testing, e.g., performance testing that includes load, stress, endurance, spike, and volume testing.

## Conclusion

These are all the prerequisite understanding that a QA engineer should acquire as knowledge.

As the saying goes, "Get the fundamentals down; the level of everything you do will rise."
