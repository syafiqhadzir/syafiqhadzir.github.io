## Introduction

End-to-end (E2E) testing is one of my favourite methodologies; used to ensure that applications behave as expected from the real-world end userâ€™s perspective.

E2E testing is a fascinating technique to evaluate application flows, often used in agile software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology.

## Manual vs Automated

Manual testing is the most primitive technique to help find bugs and defects. This method is crucial for user-friendly software development because every test cases require human intervention for execution.

Automation testing is an approach that performs with the help of an automation tool. As a project grows, manually performing everything will become cumbersome. This intricacy makes automation essential as it helps to increase the effectiveness, coverage, and efficiency of software testing.

## Horizontal vs Vertical

Horizontal E2E testing covers the entire application. It requires development teams to have clear-cut workflows and established environments.

Vertical E2E testing breaks down the application into layers (or components). It often precedes their horizontal counterparts because of this granularity.

## Conclusion

E2E plays a vital role in ensuring a satisfactory user experience. The goal is to eradicate regression bugs and defects.
