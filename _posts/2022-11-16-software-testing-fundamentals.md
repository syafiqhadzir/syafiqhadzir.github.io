## Introduction

Software testing is nothing but an art of quality inspection. The only key to success in software testing is to fulfil the must-have prerequisite, a solid understanding of the fundamentals. Due to its vast subject, I wish to write this as concisely as possible.

## All Codes Are Guilty Until Proven Innocent

It says that every software application has defects embedded in it. However, not each of them is a threat. We all agree that one may be blind to one's own mistakes. Therefore, it is essential to have a third-party inspection. Here is where software testing comes into play.

## What is a Defect?

According to Mirriam-Webster, a defect is "an imperfection or abnormality that impairs quality, function, or utility". In software testing, it is "a deviation from the specified or expected behaviour that is visible to end-users". It can be either a functional defect, a non-functional defect, or a combination of both.
Defects may exist either in the code or in its design. To a certain extent, it is a subjective matter. For example, a defect may be a feature to some people. However, it is a defect to others. Therefore, it is essential to recognise what is a defect and what is not.

## What are Severity and Priority?

Severity defines the degree of impact that a defect has on the development or operation of a component or system. The severity can be of one of the following types (and I use all the definitions from ISTQB):-
1. Critical (S1): The defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround.
2. Major (S2): The defect affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not obvious and is difficult.
3. Minor (S3): The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround.
4. Trivial (S4): The defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.

## Conclusion

Fundamentals are the foundation to understand that software testing is not just a process, but a solution.
