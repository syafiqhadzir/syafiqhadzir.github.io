Syafiq Hadzir is a software QA engineer at Cloud Connect who writes numerous write-ups regarding various technical vulnerabilities and explores new technologies. Proudly a GNU/Linux Debian-based daily user and programmer.

With experience in software development since 2016, being a developer is like a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Creating universes of virtually unlimited complexity in the form of computer programs. Almost every day, he woke up with a sip of code. Understanding how code works, where theory turned to reality.

The world of open-source is a place without Gates and Windows. Security remains one of its main concerns. The graphic quite horrible, the performance is magnificent, and the gameplay is different. Being a UNIX-Linux security researcher taught him to be alert at all times.
